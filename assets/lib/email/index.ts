/**
 * Centralised mail sending for My Career Pathshala.
 *
 * Two sender identities, chosen by purpose:
 *   • auth      → noreply@mycareerpathshala.com    — security / account mail
 *                 (login OTP, email verification & change, password change)
 *   • admission → admission@mycareerpathshala.com  — everything else
 *                 (welcome, application & counselling updates, notifications)
 *
 * Override either address with the EMAIL_FROM_AUTH / EMAIL_FROM_ADMISSION env
 * vars. The default sender is the auth identity, so any mail is treated as
 * security mail unless it explicitly opts into the admission sender.
